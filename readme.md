## Applications
This code can be used by drivers who tend to drive for a longer period of time and by students who study late at nights for exam ðŸ˜‰.

### Description

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

### Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.

### Condition

It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is lesst than 0.25, Alert is generated.
